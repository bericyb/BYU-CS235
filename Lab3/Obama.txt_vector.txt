 My fellow citizens I stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful of the sacrifices borne by our ancestors I thank President Bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition Fortyfour Americans have now taken the presidential oath The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace Yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms At these moments America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers and true to our founding documents So it has been So it must be with this generation of Americans That we are in the midst of crisis is now well understood Our nation is at war against a farreaching network of violence and hatred Our economy is badly weakened a consequence of greed and irresponsibility on the part of some but also our collective failure to make hard choices and prepare the nation for a new age Homes have been lost jobs shed businesses shuttered Our health care is too costly our schools fail too many and each day brings further evidence that the ways we use energy strengthen our adversaries and threaten our planet These are the indicators of crisis subject to data and statistics Less measurable but no less profound is a sapping of confidence across our land  a nagging fear that Americas decline is inevitable and that the next generation must lower its sights Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real They are serious and they are many They will not be met easily or in a short span of time But know this America  they will be met On this day we gather because we have chosen hope over fear unity of purpose over conflict and discord On this day we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises the recriminations and worn out dogmas that for far too long have strangled our politics We remain a young nation but in the words of Scripture the time has come to set aside childish things The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit to choose our better history to carry forward that precious gift that noble idea passed on from generation to generation the Godgiven promise that all are equal all are free and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness In reaffirming the greatness of our nation we understand that greatness is never a given It must be earned Our journey has never been one of shortcuts or settling for less It has not been the path for the fainthearted  for those who prefer leisure over work or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame Rather it has been the risktakers the doers the makers of things  some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor who have carried us up the long rugged path towards prosperity and freedom For us they packed up their few worldly possessions and traveled across oceans in search of a new life For us they toiled in sweatshops and settled the West endured the lash of the whip and plowed the hard earth For us they fought and died in places like Concord and Gettysburg Normandy and Khe Sahn Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction This is the journey we continue today We remain the most prosperous powerful nation on Earth Our workers are no less productive than when this crisis began Our minds are no less inventive our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year Our capacity remains undiminished But our time of standing pat of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions  that time has surely passed Starting today we must pick ourselves up dust ourselves off and begin again the work of remaking America For everywhere we look there is work to be done The state of the economy calls for action bold and swift and we will act  not only to create new jobs but to lay a new foundation for growth We will build the roads and bridges the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together We will restore science to its rightful place and wield technologys wonders to raise health cares quality and lower its cost We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age All this we can do And all this we will do Now there are some who question the scale of our ambitions  who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans Their memories are short For they have forgotten what this country has already done what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose and necessity to courage What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them  that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply The question we ask today is not whether our government is too big or too small but whether it works  whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage care they can afford a retirement that is dignified Where the answer is yes we intend to move forward Where the answer is no programs will end And those of us who manage the publics dollars will be held to account  to spend wisely reform bad habits and do our business in the light of day  because only then can we restore the vital trust between a people and their government Nor is the question before us whether the market is a force for good or ill Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched but this crisis has reminded us that without a watchful eye the market can spin out of control  and that a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our Gross Domestic Product but on the reach of our prosperity on the ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart  not out of charity but because it is the surest route to our common good As for our common defense we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals Our Founding Fathers faced with perils we can scarcely imagine drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man a charter expanded by the blood of generations Those ideals still light the world and we will not give them up for expediences sake And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born know that America is a friend of each nation and every man woman and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity and we are ready to lead once more Recall that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with missiles and tanks but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions They understood that our power alone cannot protect us nor does it entitle us to do as we please Instead they knew that our power grows through its prudent use our security emanates from the justness of our cause the force of our example the tempering qualities of humility and restraint We are the keepers of this legacy Guided by these principles once more we can meet those new threats that demand even greater effort  even greater cooperation and understanding between nations We will begin to responsibly leave Iraq to its people and forge a hardearned peace in Afghanistan With old friends and former foes well work tirelessly to lessen the nuclear threat and roll back the specter of a warming planet We will not apologize for our way of life nor will we waver in its defense and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken you cannot outlast us and we will defeat you For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength not a weakness We are a nation of Christians and Muslims Jews and Hindus  and nonbelievers We are shaped by every language and culture drawn from every end of this Earth and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve that as the world grows smaller our common humanity shall reveal itself and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of peace To the Muslim world we seek a new way forward based on mutual interest and mutual respect To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict or blame their societys ills on the West  know that your people will judge you on what you can build not what you destroy To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent know that you are on the wrong side of history but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist To the people of poor nations we pledge to work alongside you to make your farms flourish and let clean waters flow to nourish starved bodies and feed hungry minds And to those nations like ours that enjoy relative plenty we say we can no longer afford indifference to the suffering outside our borders nor can we consume the worlds resources without regard to effect For the world has changed and we must change with it As we consider the road that unfolds before us we remember with humble gratitude those brave Americans who at this very hour patrol faroff deserts and distant mountains They have something to tell us just as the fallen heroes who lie in Arlington whisper through the ages We honor them not only because they are guardians of our liberty but because they embody the spirit of service a willingness to find meaning in something greater than themselves And yet at this moment  a moment that will define a generation  it is precisely this spirit that must inhabit us all For as much as government can do and must do it is ultimately the faith and determination of the American people upon which this nation relies It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the levees break the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job which sees us through our darkest hours It is the firefighters courage to storm a stairway filled with smoke but also a parents willingness to nurture a child that finally decides our fate Our challenges may be new The instruments with which we meet them may be new But those values upon which our success depends  honesty and hard work courage and fair play tolerance and curiosity loyalty and patriotism  these things are old These things are true They have been the quiet force of progress throughout our history What is demanded then is a return to these truths What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility  a recognition on the part of every American that we have duties to ourselves our nation and the world duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit so defining of our character than giving our all to a difficult task This is the price and the promise of citizenship This is the source of our confidence  the knowledge that God calls on us to shape an uncertain destiny This is the meaning of our liberty and our creed  why men and women and children of every race and every faith can join in celebration across this magnificent mall and why a man whose father less than sixty years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath So let us mark this day with remembrance of who we are and how far we have traveled In the year of Americas birth in the coldest of months a small band of patriots huddled by dying campfires on the shores of an icy river The capital was abandoned The enemy was advancing The snow was stained with blood At a moment when the outcome of our revolution was most in doubt the father of our nation ordered these words be read to the people Let it be told to the future worldthat in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survivethat the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet it America In the face of our common dangers in this winter of our hardship let us remember these timeless words With hope and virtue let us brave once more the icy currents and endure what storms may come Let it be said by our childrens children that when we were tested we refused to let this journey end that we did not turn back nor did we falter and with eyes fixed on the horizon and Gods grace upon us we carried forth that great gift of freedom and delivered it safely to future generations Thank you God bless you and God bless the United States of America If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time who still questions the power of our democracy tonight is your answer Its the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen by people who waited three hours and four hours many for the very first time in their lives because they believed that this time must be different that their voice could be that difference Its the answer spoken by young and old rich and poor Democrat and Republican black white Latino Asian Native American gay straight disabled and not disabled  Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been a collection of Red States and Blue States we are and always will be the United States of America Its the answer that led those who have been told for so long by so many to be cynical and fearful and doubtful of what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day Its been a long time coming but tonight because of what we did on this day in this election at this defining moment change has come to America I just received a very gracious call from Senator McCain He fought long and hard in this campaign and hes fought even longer and harder for the country he loves He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine and we are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader I congratulate him and Governor Palin for all they have achieved and I look forward to working with them to renew this nations promise in the months ahead I want to thank my partner in this journey a man who campaigned from his heart and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on that train home to Delaware the Vice Presidentelect of the United States Joe Biden I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last sixteen years the rock of our family and the love of my life our nations next First Lady Michelle Obama Sasha and Malia I love you both so much and you have earned the new puppy thats coming with us to the White House And while shes no longer with us I know my grandmother is watching along with the family that made me who I am I miss them tonight and know that my debt to them is beyond measure To my campaign manager David Plouffe my chief strategist David Axelrod and the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics  you made this happen and I am forever grateful for what youve sacrificed to get it done But above all I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to  it belongs to you I was never the likeliest candidate for this office We didnt start with much money or many endorsements Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington  it began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give five dollars and ten dollars and twenty dollars to this cause It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generations apathy who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep from the notsoyoung people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on the doors of perfect strangers from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people by the people and for the people has not perished from this Earth This is your victory I know you didnt do this just to win an election and I know you didnt do it for me You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead For even as we celebrate tonight we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime  two wars a planet in peril the worst financial crisis in a century Even as we stand here tonight we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us There are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after their children fall asleep and wonder how theyll make the mortgage or pay their doctors bills or save enough for college There is new energy to harness and new jobs to be created new schools to build and threats to meet and alliances to repair The road ahead will be long Our climb will be steep We may not get there in one year or even one term but America  I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there I promise you  we as a people will get there There will be setbacks and false starts There are many who wont agree with every decision or policy I make as President and we know that government cant solve every problem But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face I will listen to you especially when we disagree And above all I will ask you join in the work of remaking this nation the only way its been done in America for twohundred and twentyone years  block by block brick by brick calloused hand by calloused hand What began twentyone months ago in the depths of winter must not end on this autumn night This victory alone is not the change we seek  it is only the chance for us to make that change And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were It cannot happen without you So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism of service and responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other Let us remember that if this financial crisis taught us anything its that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers  in this country we rise or fall as one nation as one people Let us resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long Let us remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House  a party founded on the values of selfreliance individual liberty and national unity Those are values we all share and while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress As Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours We are not enemies but friendsthough passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection And to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn  I may not have won your vote but I hear your voices I need your help and I will be your President too And to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores from parliaments and palaces to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of our world  our stories are singular but our destiny is shared and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand To those who would tear this world down  we will defeat you To those who seek peace and security  we support you And to all those who have wondered if Americas beacon still burns as bright  tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from our the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth but from the enduring power of our ideals democracy liberty opportunity and unyielding hope For that is the true genius of America  that America can change Our union can be perfected And what we have already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations But one thats on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta Shes a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing  Ann Nixon Cooper is  years old She was born just a generation past slavery a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky when someone like her couldnt vote for two reasons  because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin And tonight I think about all that shes seen throughout her century in America  the heartache and the hope the struggle and the progress the times we were told that we cant and the people who pressed on with that American creed Yes we can At a time when womens voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot Yes we can When there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal new jobs and a new sense of common purpose Yes we can When the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved Yes we can She was there for the buses in Montgomery the hoses in Birmingham a bridge in Selma and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that We Shall Overcome Yes we can A man touched down on the moon a wall came down in Berlin a world was connected by our own science and imagination And this year in this election she touched her finger to a screen and cast her vote because after  years in America through the best of times and the darkest of hours she knows how America can change Yes we can America we have come so far We have seen so much But there is so much more to do So tonight let us ask ourselves  if our children should live to see the next century if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper what change will they see What progress will we have made This is our chance to answer that call This is our moment This is our time  to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth  that out of many we are one that while we breathe we hope and where we are met with cynicism and doubt and those who tell us that we cant we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people Yes We Can Thank you God bless you and may God Bless the United States of America What a scene What a crowd Thank you for Virginia Crowd chants yes we can Let me start by noting Virginia that this is our last rally This is the last rally of a campaign that began nearly  years ago Weve gone to every corner of this country from here in Northern Virginia to the rocky coasts of Maine to the open plains of Texas to the open skies of Montana I just want to say that whatever happens tomorrow I have been deeply humbled by this journey You have welcomed Michelle and me and the girls into your homes You have shared your stories of struggle you have spoken of your dreams along the way talking with all of you about your own lives You have enriched my life you have moved me again and again You have inspired me Sometimes when I have been down you have lifted me up You filled me with new hope for our future and you have reminded me about what makes America so special In the places I have gone and the people I have met I have been struck again and again by the fundamental decency and generosity and dignity of men and women who work hard without complaint to meet their responsibilities every day I come away with an unyielding belief that if we only had a government as responsible as all of you as compassionate as the American people that there is no obstacle that we cant overcome There is no destiny that we cannot fulfill Virginia I have just one word for you just one word Tomorrow Tomorrow After decades of broken politics in Washington  years of failed policies from George Bush twentyone months of campaigning we are less then one day away from bringing about change in America Tomorrow you can turn the page on policies that put greed and irresponsibility before hard work and sacrifice Tomorrow you can choose policies that invest in our middle class create new jobs and grow this economy so that everybody has a chance to succeed Not just the CEO but the secretary and the janitor not just the factory owner but the men and women who work the factory floor Tomorrow you can put an end to the politics that would divide a nation just to win an election that puts reason against reason and city against town Republican against Democrat that asks us to fear at a time when we need to hope Tomorrow at this defining moment in history you can give this country the change that we need It starts here in Virginia It starts here in Manassas This is where change begins Our campaign has not been perfect There are times when I look back and Ive said you know I wouldnt have done that if I had thought about it a little bit more But Ill tell you what When you think about this campaign weve got a lot to be proud of when it comes to the tone that we have set We tried to argue issues and not engage in personal attacks Weve been fierce in defending ourselves but weve tried to make sure that we are always reminding our supporters that all of us are in this together Black white Hispanic native American Asian Democrats and Republicans young and old rich and poor gay and straight disabled and not disabled all of us have something to contribute We tried to communicate for these last two years that we cant afford the same political games the same tactics that pit us against one another that make us afraid of each other We cant afford that anymore Not this time Despite what our opponents might claim there are no real or fake parts of Virginia anymore and then there are real or fake parts of America There is no city or town that is more proAmerica than anywhere else We are all one nation All of us proud All of us patriots All of us salute this flag The men and women who serve on our battlefields come from many walks of life different political parties but they fought together and they bled together Some die together under the same proud flag They have not served red America or blue America they have served the United States of America And that is what this campaign has been about were calling us to serve the United States of America In this campaign I have had the privilege to witness what is best in America in the stories in the faces of men and women I have met at countless rallies town hall meetings VFW halls living rooms diners all across America men and women who shared with me their stories and spoke of their struggles but they also spoke of their hopes and dreams They want for their children a sense of obligation and debts to be paid to earlier generations I met one of those women in Greenwood South Carolina It was back early when we were way back in the polls Nobody gave us much of a chance back then I had gone to South Carolina early in the campaign to see what I could stir up in the way of endorsements and I was at a legislative dinner sitting next to a state representative that I really wanted to endorse me So I turned to her and I said I really want your endorsement And she looked at me and she said Ill tell you what Obama I will give you my endorsement if you come to my hometown of Greenwood South Carolina I must have had a sip of wine or something that night because right away I said Okay Im coming So the next time I come to South Carolina its about a month later We fly in about midnight We get to the hotel about one oclock in the morning Im exhausted Im dragging my bags to my room when I get a tap on my shoulder and I look back and it is one of my staff people who says Senator we need to be out of the hotel by  am I say Why is that He says because we have to go to Greenwood like you promised So the next morning I wake up and I feel terrible and I think I am coming down with a cold my back is sore I feel worse than when I went to bed I open up the curtains in the hotel room to get some sunlight in and hopefully wake me up but its pouring down rain I go outside my room and get the New York Times and there is a bad story about me in the New York Times I go downstairs after I pack and my umbrella blows open and I get soaked so by the time I get in the car I am mad I am wet and I am sleepy We drive and we drive and we drive It turns out that Greenwood is about an hour and a half from everywhere else Finally we get to Greenwood First of all you do not know youre in Greenwood when you get to Greenwood there arent a lot of tall buildings in Greenwood We pull off to a small building  a little field house in a park  and we go inside and low and behold after an hour and a half drive turns out there are  people there Twenty people They look all kind of damp and sleepy maybe they arent really excited to be there either But I am a professional Ive got to do what I got to do Im going around Im shaking hands I am saying How are you doing What are you doing As I go around the room suddenly I hear this voice cry out behind me fired up Im shocked I jumped up I dont know what is going on But everyone else acts as though this were normal and they say fired up Then I hear this voice say ready to go And the  people in the room act like this happens all the time and they say ready to go I dont know whats going on so I looked behind me and there is this small woman about  years old a little over  feet looks like she just came from church  shes got on a big church hat Shes standing there she looks at me and she smiles and she says fired up It turns out that she was a city Councilwoman from Greenwood who also moonlights as a private detective Im not making this up And it turns out that she is famous for her chant She does this where ever she goes She says fired up and the people say fired up and she says ready to go and they say ready to go For the next five minutes she proceeds to do this Fired up and everyone says fired up and she says ready to go and they say ready to go Im standing there and Im thinking Im being outflanked by this woman Shes stealing my thunder I look at my staff and they shrugged their shoulders they dont know how long this is going to go on But heres the thing Virginia After a minute or so I am feeling kind of fired up Im feeling like Im ready to go So I join in the chant It feels good For the rest of the day even after we left Greenwood even though it was still raining even though I was still not getting big crowds anywhere even though we hadnt gotten the endorsement from the people we were hoping for somehow I felt a little lighter a little better Id see my staff and I would say Are you fired up and they would say We are fired up boss are you ready to go And Id say Im ready to go Heres my point Virginia Thats how this thing started It shows you what one voice can do That one voice can change a room And if a voice can change a room it can change a city and if it can change a city it can change a state and if it can change a state it can change a nation and if it can change a nation it can change the world Virginia your voice can change the world tomorrow In  hours if you are willing to endure some rain if you are willing to drag that person you know who is not going to vote to the polls If you are willing to organize and volunteer in the offices if you are willing to stand with me if you are willing to fight with me I know your voice will matter So I have just one question for you Virginia Are you fired up Ready to go Fired up Ready to go Fired up Ready to go Fired up Ready to go Virginia lets go change the world God bless you and God bless the United States of America my fellow citizens of this great nation With profound gratitude and great humility I accept your nomination for the presidency of the United States Let me express my thanks to the historic slate of candidates who accompanied me on this journey and especially the one who traveled the farthest  a champion for working Americans and an inspiration to my daughters and to yours  Hillary Rodham Clinton To President Clinton who last night made the case for change as only he can make it to Ted Kennedy who embodies the spirit of service and to the next Vice President of the United States Joe Biden I thank you I am grateful to finish this journey with one of the finest statesmen of our time a man at ease with everyone from world leaders to the conductors on the Amtrak train he still takes home every night To the love of my life our next First Lady Michelle Obama and to Sasha and Malia  I love you so much and Im so proud of all of you Four years ago I stood before you and told you my story  of the brief union between a young man from Kenya and a young woman from Kansas who werent welloff or wellknown but shared a belief that in America their son could achieve whatever he put his mind to It is that promise that has always set this country apart  that through hard work and sacrifice each of us can pursue our individual dreams but still come together as one American family to ensure that the next generation can pursue their dreams as well Thats why I stand here tonight Because for two hundred and thirty two years at each moment when that promise was in jeopardy ordinary men and women  students and soldiers farmers and teachers nurses and janitors  found the courage to keep it alive We meet at one of those defining moments  a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the American promise has been threatened once more Tonight more Americans are out of work and more are working harder for less More of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet More of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach These challenges are not all of governments making But the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in Washington and the failed policies of George W Bush America we are better than these last eight years We are a better country than this This country is more decent than one where a woman in Ohio on the brink of retirement finds herself one illness away from disaster after a lifetime of hard work This country is more generous than one where a man in Indiana has to pack up the equipment hes worked on for twenty years and watch it shipped off to China and then chokes up as he explains how he felt like a failure when he went home to tell his family the news We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes Tonight I say to the American people to Democrats and Republicans and Independents across this great land  enough This moment  this election  is our chance to keep in the st century the American promise alive Because next week in Minnesota the same party that brought you two terms of George Bush and Dick Cheney will ask this country for a third And we are here because we love this country too much to let the next four years look like the last eight On November th we must stand up and say Eight is enough Now let there be no doubt The Republican nominee John McCain has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect And next week well also hear about those occasions when hes broken with his party as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need But the records clear John McCain has voted with George Bush ninety percent of the time Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time I dont know about you but Im not ready to take a ten percent chance on change The truth is on issue after issue that would make a difference in your lives  on health care and education and the economy  Senator McCain has been anything but independent He said that our economy has made great progress under this President He said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong And when one of his chief advisors  the man who wrote his economic plan  was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling he said that we were just suffering from a mental recession and that weve become and I quote a nation of whiners A nation of whiners Tell that to the proud auto workers at a Michigan plant who after they found out it was closing kept showing up every day and working as hard as ever because they knew there were people who counted on the brakes that they made Tell that to the military families who shoulder their burdens silently as they watch their loved ones leave for their third or fourth or fifth tour of duty These are not whiners They work hard and give back and keep going without complaint These are the Americans that I know Now I dont believe that Senator McCain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of Americans I just think he doesnt know Why else would he define middleclass as someone making under five million dollars a year How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax peoples benefits or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement Its not because John McCain doesnt care Its because John McCain doesnt get it For over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited Republican philosophy  give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else In Washington they call this the Ownership Society but what it really means is  youre on your own Out of work Tough luck No health care The market will fix it Born into poverty Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps  even if you dont have boots Youre on your own Well its time for them to own their failure Its time for us to change America You see we Democrats have a very different measure of what constitutes progress in this country We measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage whether you can put a little extra money away at the end of each month so you can someday watch your child receive her college diploma We measure progress in the  million new jobs that were created when Bill Clinton was President  when the average American family saw its income go up  instead of down  like it has under George Bush We measure the strength of our economy not by the number of billionaires we have or the profits of the Fortune  but by whether someone with a good idea can take a risk and start a new business or whether the waitress who lives on tips can take a day off to look after a sick kid without losing her job  an economy that honors the dignity of work The fundamentals we use to measure economic strength are whether we are living up to that fundamental promise that has made this country great  a promise that is the only reason I am standing here tonight Because in the faces of those young veterans who come back from Iraq and Afghanistan I see my grandfather who signed up after Pearl Harbor marched in Pattons Army and was rewarded by a grateful nation with the chance to go to college on the GI Bill In the face of that young student who sleeps just three hours before working the night shift I think about my mom who raised my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree who once turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in the country with the help of student loans and scholarships When I listen to another worker tell me that his factory has shut down I remember all those men and women on the South Side of Chicago who I stood by and fought for two decades ago after the local steel plant closed And when I hear a woman talk about the difficulties of starting her own business I think about my grandmother who worked her way up from the secretarial pool to middlemanagement despite years of being passed over for promotions because she was a woman Shes the one who taught me about hard work Shes the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that I could have a better life She poured everything she had into me And although she can no longer travel I know that shes watching tonight and that tonight is her night as well I dont know what kind of lives John McCain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine These are my heroes Theirs are the stories that shaped me And it is on their behalf that I intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as President of the United States What is that promise Its a promise that says each of us has the freedom to make of our own lives what we will but that we also have the obligation to treat each other with dignity and respect Its a promise that says the market should reward drive and innovation and generate growth but that businesses should live up to their responsibilities to create American jobs look out for American workers and play by the rules of the road Ours is a promise that says government cannot solve all our problems but what it should do is that which we cannot do for ourselves  protect us from harm and provide every child a decent education keep our water clean and our toys safe invest in new schools and new roads and new science and technology Our government should work for us not against us It should help us not hurt us It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence but for every American whos willing to work Thats the promise of America  the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that I am my brothers keeper I am my sisters keeper Thats the promise we need to keep Thats the change we need right now So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President Change means a tax code that doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it Unlike John McCain I will stop giving tax breaks to corporations that ship jobs overseas and I will start giving them to companies that create good jobs right here in America I will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and the startups that will create the highwage hightech jobs of tomorrow I will cut taxes  cut taxes  for  of all working families Because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middleclass And for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet I will set a clear goal as President in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the Middle East Washingtons been talking about our oil addiction for the last thirty years and John McCain has been there for twentysix of them In that time hes said no to higher fuelefficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels And today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that Senator McCain took office Now is the time to end this addiction and to understand that drilling is a stopgap measure not a longterm solution Not even close As President I will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power Ill help our auto companies retool so that the fuelefficient cars of the future are built right here in America Ill make it easier for the American people to afford these new cars And Ill invest  billion dollars over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy  wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced America now is not the time for small plans Now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a worldclass education because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy Michelle and I are only here tonight because we were given a chance at an education And I will not settle for an America where some kids dont have that chance Ill invest in early childhood education Ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support And in exchange Ill ask for higher standards and more accountability And we will keep our promise to every young American  if you commit to serving your community or your country we will make sure you can afford a college education Now is the time to finally keep the promise of affordable accessible health care for every single American If you have health care my plan will lower your premiums If you dont youll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves And as someone who watched my mother argue with insurance companies while she lay in bed dying of cancer I will make certain those companies stop discriminating against those who are sick and need care the most Now is the time to help families with paid sick days and better family leave because nobody in America should have to choose between keeping their jobs and caring for a sick child or ailing parent Now is the time to change our bankruptcy laws so that your pensions are protected ahead of CEO bonuses and the time to protect Social Security for future generations And now is the time to keep the promise of equal pay for an equal days work because I want my daughters to have exactly the same opportunities as your sons Now many of these plans will cost money which is why Ive laid out how Ill pay for every dime  by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help America grow But I will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less  because we cannot meet twentyfirst century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy And Democrats we must also admit that fulfilling Americas promise will require more than just money It will require a renewed sense of responsibility from each of us to recover what John F Kennedy called our intellectual and moral strength Yes government must lead on energy independence but each of us must do our part to make our homes and businesses more efficient Yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair But we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility for providing the love and guidance their children need Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility  thats the essence of Americas promise And just as we keep our keep our promise to the next generation here at home so must we keep Americas promise abroad If John McCain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next CommanderinChief thats a debate Im ready to have For while Senator McCain was turning his sights to Iraq just days after  I stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face When John McCain said we could just muddle through in Afghanistan I argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on  and made clear that we must take out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants if we have them in our sights John McCain likes to say that hell follow bin Laden to the Gates of Hell  but he wont even go to the cave where he lives And today as my call for a time frame to remove our troops from Iraq has been echoed by the Iraqi government and even the Bush Administration even after we learned that Iraq has a  billion surplus while were wallowing in deficits John McCain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war Thats not the judgment we need That wont keep America safe We need a President who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past You dont defeat a terrorist network that operates in eighty countries by occupying Iraq You dont protect Israel and deter Iran just by talking tough in Washington You cant truly stand up for Georgia when youve strained our oldest alliances If John McCain wants to follow George Bush with more tough talk and bad strategy that is his choice  but it is not the change we need We are the party of Roosevelt We are the party of Kennedy So dont tell me that Democrats wont defend this country Dont tell me that Democrats wont keep us safe The BushMcCain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of Americans  Democrats and Republicans  have built and we are here to restore that legacy As CommanderinChief I will never hesitate to defend this nation but I will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home I will end this war in Iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan I will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts But I will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb Russian aggression I will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease And I will restore our moral standing so that America is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future These are the policies I will pursue And in the weeks ahead I look forward to debating them with John McCain But what I will not do is suggest that the Senator takes his positions for political purposes Because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism The times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook So let us agree that patriotism has no party I love this country and so do you and so does John McCain The men and women who serve in our battlefields may be Democrats and Republicans and Independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag They have not served a Red America or a Blue America  they have served the United States of America So Ive got news for you John McCain We all put our country first America our work will not be easy The challenges we face require tough choices and Democrats as well as Republicans will need to cast off the wornout ideas and politics of the past For part of what has been lost these past eight years cant just be measured by lost wages or bigger trade deficits What has also been lost is our sense of common purpose  our sense of higher purpose And thats what we have to restore We may not agree on abortion but surely we can agree on reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies in this country The reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural Ohio than for those plagued by gangviolence in Cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the Second Amendment while keeping AKs out of the hands of criminals I know there are differences on samesex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination Passions fly on immigration but I dont know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers This too is part of Americas promise  the promise of a democracy where we can find the strength and grace to bridge divides and unite in common effort I know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk They claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a Trojan Horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values And thats to be expected Because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters If you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from You make a big election about small things And you know what  its worked before Because it feeds into the cynicism we all have about government When Washington doesnt work all its promises seem empty If your hopes have been dashed again and again then its best to stop hoping and settle for what you already know I get it I realize that I am not the likeliest candidate for this office I dont fit the typical pedigree and I havent spent my career in the halls of Washington But I stand before you tonight because all across America something is stirring What the naysayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me Its been about you For eighteen long months you have stood up one by one and said enough to the politics of the past You understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result You have shown what history teaches us  that at defining moments like this one the change we need doesnt come from Washington Change comes to Washington Change happens because the American people demand it  because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time America this is one of those moments I believe that as hard as it will be the change we need is coming Because Ive seen it Because Ive lived it Ive seen it in Illinois when we provided health care to more children and moved more families from welfare to work Ive seen it in Washington when we worked across party lines to open up government and hold lobbyists more accountable to give better care for our veterans and keep nuclear weapons out of terrorist hands And Ive seen it in this campaign In the young people who voted for the first time and in those who got involved again after a very long time In the Republicans who never thought theyd pick up a Democratic ballot but did Ive seen it in the workers who would rather cut their hours back a day than see their friends lose their jobs in the soldiers who reenlist after losing a limb in the good neighbors who take a stranger in when a hurricane strikes and the floodwaters rise This country of ours has more wealth than any nation but thats not what makes us rich We have the most powerful military on Earth but thats not what makes us strong Our universities and our culture are the envy of the world but thats not what keeps the world coming to our shores Instead it is that American spirit  that American promise  that pushes us forward even when the path is uncertain that binds us together in spite of our differences that makes us fix our eye not on what is seen but what is unseen that better place around the bend That promise is our greatest inheritance Its a promise I make to my daughters when I tuck them in at night and a promise that you make to yours  a promise that has led immigrants to cross oceans and pioneers to travel west a promise that led workers to picket lines and women to reach for the ballot And it is that promise that forty five years ago today brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington before Lincolns Memorial and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream The men and women who gathered there couldve heard many things They couldve heard words of anger and discord They couldve been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred But what the people heard instead  people of every creed and color from every walk of life  is that in America our destiny is inextricably linked That together our dreams can be one We cannot walk alone the preacher cried And as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead We cannot turn back America we cannot turn back Not with so much work to be done Not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for Not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save Not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend America we cannot turn back We cannot walk alone At this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future Let us keep that promise  that American promise  and in the words of Scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess Thank you and God Bless the United States of America obamaspeechescom Barack Obama Speech  Final Primary Night  Presumptive Nominee  minutes Final Primary Night Presumptive Democratic Nominee Speech St Paul Minnesota June   Tonight after fiftyfour hardfought contests our primary season has finally come to an end Sixteen months have passed since we first stood together on the steps of the Old State Capitol in Springfield Illinois Thousands of miles have been traveled Millions of voices have been heard And because of what you said  because you decided that change must come to Washington because you believed that this year must be different than all the rest because you chose to listen not to your doubts or your fears but to your greatest hopes and highest aspirations tonight we mark the end of one historic journey with the beginning of another  a journey that will bring a new and better day to America Tonight I can stand before you and say that I will be the Democratic nominee for President of the United States I want to thank every American who stood with us over the course of this campaign  through the good days and the bad from the snows of Cedar Rapids to the sunshine of Sioux Falls And tonight I also want to thank the men and woman who took this journey with me as fellow candidates for President At this defining moment for our nation we should be proud that our party put forth one of the most talented qualified field of individuals ever to run for this office I have not just competed with them as rivals I have learned from them as friends as public servants and as patriots who love America and are willing to work tirelessly to make this country better They are leaders of this party and leaders that America will turn to for years to come That is particularly true for the candidate who has traveled further on this journey than anyone else Senator Hillary Clinton has made history in this campaign not just because shes a woman who has done what no woman has done before but because shes a leader who inspires millions of Americans with her strength her courage and her commitment to the causes that brought us here tonight Weve certainly had our differences over the last sixteen months But as someone whos shared a stage with her many times I can tell you that what gets Hillary Clinton up in the morning  even in the face of tough odds  is exactly what sent her and Bill Clinton to sign up for their first campaign in Texas all those years ago what sent her to work at the Childrens Defense Fund and made her fight for health care as First Lady what led her to the United States Senate and fueled her barrierbreaking campaign for the presidency  an unyielding desire to improve the lives of ordinary Americans no matter how difficult the fight may be And you can rest assured that when we finally win the battle for universal health care in this country she will be central to that victory When we transform our energy policy and lift our children out of poverty it will be because she worked to help make it happen Our party and our country are better off because of her and I am a better candidate for having had the honor to compete with Hillary Rodham Clinton There are those who say that this primary has somehow left us weaker and more divided Well I say that because of this primary there are millions of Americans who have cast their ballot for the very first time There are Independents and Republicans who understand that this election isnt just about the party in charge of Washington its about the need to change Washington There are young people and AfricanAmericans and Latinos and women of all ages who have voted in numbers that have broken records and inspired a nation All of you chose to support a candidate you believe in deeply But at the end of the day we arent the reason you came out and waited in lines that stretched block after block to make your voice heard You didnt do that because of me or Senator Clinton or anyone else You did it because you know in your hearts that at this moment  a moment that will define a generation  we cannot afford to keep doing what weve been doing We owe our children a better future We owe our country a better future And for all those who dream of that future tonight I say  let us begin the work together Let us unite in common effort to chart a new course for America In just a few short months the Republican Party will arrive in St Paul with a very different agenda They will come here to nominate John McCain a man who has served this country heroically I honor that service and I respect his many accomplishments even if he chooses to deny mine My differences with him are not personal they are with the policies he has proposed in this campaign Because while John McCain can legitimately tout moments of independence from his party in the past such independence has not been the hallmark of his presidential campaign Its not change when John McCain decided to stand with George Bush ninetyfive percent of the time as he did in the Senate last year Its not change when he offers four more years of Bush economic policies that have failed to create wellpaying jobs or insure our workers or help Americans afford the skyrocketing cost of college  policies that have lowered the real incomes of the average American family widened the gap between Wall Street and Main Street and left our children with a mountain of debt And its not change when he promises to continue a policy in Iraq that asks everything of our brave men and women in uniform and nothing of Iraqi politicians  a policy where all we look for are reasons to stay in Iraq while we spend billions of dollars a month on a war that isnt making the American people any safer So Ill say this  there are many words to describe John McCains attempt to pass off his embrace of George Bushs policies as bipartisan and new But change is not one of them Change is a foreign policy that doesnt begin and end with a war that shouldve never been authorized and never been waged I wont stand here and pretend that there are many good options left in Iraq but whats not an option is leaving our troops in that country for the next hundred years  especially at a time when our military is overstretched our nation is isolated and nearly every other threat to America is being ignored We must be as careful getting out of Iraq as we were careless getting in  but start leaving we must Its time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their future Its time to rebuild our military and give our veterans the care they need and the benefits they deserve when they come home Its time to refocus our efforts on al Qaedas leadership and Afghanistan and rally the world against the common threats of the st century  terrorism and nuclear weapons climate change and poverty genocide and disease Thats what change is Change is realizing that meeting todays threats requires not just our firepower but the power of our diplomacy  tough direct diplomacy where the President of the United States isnt afraid to let any petty dictator know where America stands and what we stand for We must once again have the courage and conviction to lead the free world That is the legacy of Roosevelt and Truman and Kennedy Thats what the American people want Thats what change is Change is building an economy that rewards not just wealth but the work and workers who created it Its understanding that the struggles facing working families cant be solved by spending billions of dollars on more tax breaks for big corporations and wealthy CEOs but by giving a the middleclass a tax break and investing in our crumbling infrastructure and transforming how we use energy and improving our schools and renewing our commitment to science and innovation Its understanding that fiscal responsibility and shared prosperity can go handinhand as they did when Bill Clinton was President John McCain has spent a lot of time talking about trips to Iraq in the last few weeks but maybe if he spent some time taking trips to the cities and towns that have been hardest hit by this economy  cities in Michigan and Ohio and right here in Minnesota  hed understand the kind of change that people are looking for Maybe if he went to Iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still cant pay the medical bills for a sister whos ill hed understand that she cant afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and wealthy She needs us to pass health care plan that guarantees insurance to every American who wants it and brings down premiums for every family who needs it Thats the change we need Maybe if he went to Pennsylvania and met the man who lost his job but cant even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one hed understand that we cant afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators That man needs us to pass an energy policy that works with automakers to raise fuel standards and makes corporations pay for their pollution and oil companies invest their record profits in a clean energy future  an energy policy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cant be outsourced Thats the change we need And maybe if he spent some time in the schools of South Carolina or St Paul or where he spoke tonight in New Orleans hed understand that we cant afford to leave the money behind for No Child Left Behind that we owe it to our children to invest in early childhood education to recruit an army of new teachers and give them better pay and more support to finally decide that in this global economy the chance to get a college education should not be a privilege for the wealthy few but the birthright of every American Thats the change we need in America Thats why Im running for President The other side will come here in September and offer a very different set of policies and positions and that is a debate I look forward to It is a debate the American people deserve But what you dont deserve is another election thats governed by fear and innuendo and division What you wont hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon  that sees our opponents not as competitors to challenge but enemies to demonize Because we may call ourselves Democrats and Republicans but we are Americans first We are always Americans first Despite what the good Senator from Arizona said tonight I have seen people of differing views and opinions find common cause many times during my two decades in public life and I have brought many together myself Ive walked arminarm with community leaders on the South Side of Chicago and watched tensions fade as black white and Latino fought together for good jobs and good schools Ive sat across the table from law enforcement and civil rights advocates to reform a criminal justice system that sent thirteen innocent people to death row And Ive worked with friends in the other party to provide more children with health insurance and more working families with a tax break to curb the spread of nuclear weapons and ensure that the American people know where their tax dollars are being spent and to reduce the influence of lobbyists who have all too often set the agenda in Washington In our country I have found that this cooperation happens not because we agree on everything but because behind all the labels and false divisions and categories that define us beyond all the petty bickering and pointscoring in Washington Americans are a decent generous compassionate people united by common challenges and common hopes And every so often there are moments which call on that fundamental goodness to make this country great again So it was for that band of patriots who declared in a Philadelphia hall the formation of a more perfect union and for all those who gave on the fields of Gettysburg and Antietam their last full measure of devotion to save that same union So it was for the Greatest Generation that conquered fear itself and liberated a continent from tyranny and made this country home to untold opportunity and prosperity So it was for the workers who stood out on the picket lines the women who shattered glass ceilings the children who braved a Selma bridge for freedoms cause So it has been for every generation that faced down the greatest challenges and the most improbable odds to leave their children a world thats better and kinder and more just And so it must be for us America this is our moment This is our time Our time to turn the page on the policies of the past Our time to bring new energy and new ideas to the challenges we face Our time to offer a new direction for the country we love The journey will be difficult The road will be long I face this challenge with profound humility and knowledge of my own limitations But I also face it with limitless faith in the capacity of the American people Because if we are willing to work for it and fight for it and believe in it then I am absolutely certain that generations from now we will be able to look back and tell our children that this was the moment when we began to provide care for the sick and good jobs to the jobless this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal this was the moment when we ended a war and secured our nation and restored our image as the last best hope on Earth This was the moment  this was the time  when we came together to remake this great nation so that it may always reflect our very best selves and our highest ideals Thank you God Bless you and may God Bless the United States of America Well we are in the middle of a very close race right now in Texas and we may not even know the final results until morning We do know that Senator Clinton has won Rhode Island and while there are a lot of votes to be counted in Ohio it looks like she did well there too and so we congratulate her on those states We also know that we have won the state of Vermont And we know this  no matter what happens tonight we have nearly the same delegate lead as we did this morning and we are on our way to winning this nomination You know decades ago as a community organizer I learned that the real work of democracy begins far from the closed doors and marbled halls of Washington It begins on street corners and front porches in living rooms and meeting halls with ordinary Americans who see the world as it is and realize that we have it within our power to remake the world as it should be It is with that hope that we began this unlikely journey  the hope that if we could go block by block city by city state by state and build a movement that spanned race and region party and gender if we could give young people a reason to vote and the young at heart a reason to believe again if we could inspire a nation to come together again then we could turn the page on the politics thats shut us out let us down and told us to settle We could write a new chapter in the American story We were told this wasnt possible We were told the climb was too steep We were told our country was too cynical  that we were just being nave that we couldnt really change the world as it is But then a few people in Iowa stood up to say Yes we can And then a few more of you stood up from the hills of New Hampshire to the coast of South Carolina And then a few million of you stood up from Savannah to Seattle from Boise to Baton Rouge And tonight because of you  because of a movement you built that stretches from Vermonts Green Mountains to the streets of San Antonio we can stand up with confidence and clarity to say that we are turning the page and we are ready to write the next great chapter in Americas story In the coming weeks we will begin a great debate about the future of this country with a man who has served it bravely and loves it dearly And tonight I called John McCain and congratulated him on winning the Republican nomination But in this election we will offer two very different visions of the America we see in the twentyfirst century Because John McCain may claim long history of straight talk and independentthinking and I respect that But in this campaign hes fallen in line behind the very same policies that have illserved America He has seen where George Bush has taken our country and he promises to keep us on the very same course Its the same course that threatens a century of war in Iraq  a third and fourth and fifth tour of duty for brave troops whove done all weve asked them to even while we ask little and expect nothing of the Iraqi government whose job it is to put their country back together A course where we spend billions of dollars a week that could be used to rebuild our roads and our schools to care for our veterans and send our children to college Its the same course that continues to divide and isolate America from the world by substituting bluster and bullying for direct diplomacy  by ignoring our allies and refusing to talk to our enemies even though Presidents from Kennedy to Reagan have done just that because strong countries and strong leaders arent afraid to tell hard truths to petty dictators And its the same course that offers the same tired answer to workers without health care and families without homes to students in debt and children who go to bed hungry in the richest nation on Earth  four more years of tax breaks for the biggest corporations and the wealthiest few who dont need them and arent even asking for them Its a course that further divides Wall Street from Main Street where struggling families are told to pull themselves up by their bootstraps because theres nothing government can do or should do  and so we should give more to those with the most and let the chips fall where they may Well we are here tonight to say that this is not the America we believe in and this is not the future we want We want a new course for this country We want new leadership in Washington We want change in America John McCain and Senator Clinton echo each other in dismissing this call for change They say it is eloquent but empty speeches and not solutions And yet they should know that its a call that did not begin with my words It began with words that were spoken on the floors of factories in Ohio and across the deep plains of Texas words that came from classrooms in South Carolina and living rooms in the state of Iowa from firsttime voters and lifelong cynics from Democrats and Republicans alike They should know that theres nothing empty about the call for affordable health care that came from the young student who told me she gets three hours of sleep because she works the night shift after a full day of college and still cant pay her sisters medical bills Theres nothing empty about the call for help that came from the mother in San Antonio who saw her mortgage double in two weeks and didnt know where her twoyear olds would sleep at night when they were kicked out of their home Theres nothing empty about the call for change that came from the elderly woman who wants it so badly that she sent me an envelope with a money order for  and a simple verse of scripture tucked inside These Americans know that government cannot solve all of our problems and they dont expect it to Americans know that we have to work harder and study more to compete in a global economy We know that we need to take responsibility for ourselves and our children  that we need to spend more time with them and teach them well and put a book in their hands instead of a video game once in awhile We know this But we also believe that there is a larger responsibility we have to one another as Americans We believe that we rise or fall as one nation  as one people That we are our brothers keeper That we are our sisters keeper We believe that a child born tonight should have the same chances whether she arrives in the barrios of San Antonio or the suburbs of St Louis on the streets of Chicago or the hills of Appalachia We believe that when she goes to school for the first time it should be in a place where the rats dont outnumber the computers that when she applies to college cost is no barrier to a degree that will allow her to compete with children in China or India for the jobs of the twentyfirst century We believe that these jobs should provide wages that can raise her family health care for when she gets sick and a pension for when she retires We believe that when she tucks her own children into bed she should feel safe knowing that they are protected from the threats we face by the bravest bestequipped military in the world led by a CommanderinChief who has the judgment to know when to send them into battle and which battlefield to fight on And if that child should ever get the chance to travel the world and someone should ask her where she is from we believe that she should always be able to hold her head high with pride in her voice when she answers I am an American That is the course we seek That is the change we are calling for You can call it many things but you cannot call it empty If I am the nominee of this party I will not allow us to be distracted by the same politics that seeks to divide us with false charges and meaningless labels In this campaign we will not stand for the politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon I owe what I am to this country I love and I will never forget it Where else could a young man who grew up herding goats in Kenya get the chance to fulfill his dream of a college education Where else could he marry a white girl from Kansas whose parents survived war and depression to find opportunity out west Where else could they have a child who would one day have the chance to run for the highest office in the greatest nation the world has ever known Where else but in the United States of America It is now my hope and our task to set this country on a course that will keep this promise alive in the twentyfirst century And the eyes of the world are watching to see if we can There is a young man on my campaign whose grandfather lives in Uganda He is  years old and has never experienced true democracy in his lifetime During the reign of Idi Amin he was literally hunted and the only reason he escaped was thanks to the kindness of others and a few goodsized trunks And on the night of the Iowa caucuses that yearold man stayed up until five in the morning huddled by his television waiting for the results The world is watching what we do here The world is paying attention to how we conduct ourselves What will we they see What will we tell them What will we show them Can we come together across party and region race and religion to restore prosperity and opportunity as the birthright of every American Can we lead the community of nations in taking on the common threats of the st century  terrorism and climate change genocide and disease Can we send a message to all those weary travelers beyond our shores who long to be free from fear and want that the United States of America is and always will be the last best hope of Earth We say we hope we believe  yes we can Let me begin by saying thanks to all you whove traveled from far and wide to brave the cold today We all made this journey for a reason Its humbling but in my heart I know you didnt come here just for me you came here because you believe in what this country can be In the face of war you believe there can be peace In the face of despair you believe there can be hope In the face of a politics thats shut you out thats told you to settle thats divided us for too long you believe we can be one people reaching for whats possible building that more perfect union Thats the journey were on today But let me tell you how I came to be here As most of you know I am not a native of this great state I moved to Illinois over two decades ago I was a young man then just a year out of college I knew no one in Chicago was without money or family connections But a group of churches had offered me a job as a community organizer for  a year And I accepted the job sight unseen motivated then by a single simple powerful idea  that I might play a small part in building a better America My work took me to some of Chicagos poorest neighborhoods I joined with pastors and laypeople to deal with communities that had been ravaged by plant closings I saw that the problems people faced werent simply local in nature  that the decision to close a steel mill was made by distant executives that the lack of textbooks and computers in schools could be traced to the skewed priorities of politicians a thousand miles away and that when a child turns to violence theres a hole in his heart no government could ever fill It was in these neighborhoods that I received the best education I ever had and where I learned the true meaning of my Christian faith After three years of this work I went to law school because I wanted to understand how the law should work for those in need I became a civil rights lawyer and taught constitutional law and after a time I came to understand that our cherished rights of liberty and equality depend on the active participation of an awakened electorate It was with these ideas in mind that I arrived in this capital city as a state Senator It was here in Springfield where I saw all that is America converge  farmers and teachers businessmen and laborers all of them with a story to tell all of them seeking a seat at the table all of them clamoring to be heard I made lasting friendships here  friends that I see in the audience today It was here we learned to disagree without being disagreeable  that its possible to compromise so long as you know those principles that can never be compromised and that so long as were willing to listen to each other we can assume the best in people instead of the worst Thats why we were able to reform a death penalty system that was broken Thats why we were able to give health insurance to children in need Thats why we made the tax system more fair and just for working families and thats why we passed ethics reforms that the cynics said could never ever be passed It was here in Springfield where North South East and West come together that I was reminded of the essential decency of the American people  where I came to believe that through this decency we can build a more hopeful America And that is why in the shadow of the Old State Capitol where Lincoln once called on a divided house to stand together where common hopes and common dreams still I stand before you today to announce my candidacy for President of the United States I recognize there is a certain presumptuousness  a certain audacity  to this announcement I know I havent spent a lot of time learning the ways of Washington But Ive been there long enough to know that the ways of Washington must change The genius of our founders is that they designed a system of government that can be changed And we should take heart because weve changed this country before In the face of tyranny a band of patriots brought an Empire to its knees In the face of secession we unified a nation and set the captives free In the face of Depression we put people back to work and lifted millions out of poverty We welcomed immigrants to our shores we opened railroads to the west we landed a man on the moon and we heard a Kings call to let justice roll down like water and righteousness like a mighty stream Each and every time a new generation has risen up and done whats needed to be done Today we are called once more  and it is time for our generation to answer that call For that is our unyielding faith  that in the face of impossible odds people who love their country can change it Thats what Abraham Lincoln understood He had his doubts He had his defeats He had his setbacks But through his will and his words he moved a nation and helped free a people It is because of the millions who rallied to his cause that we are no longer divided North and South slave and free It is because men and women of every race from every walk of life continued to march for freedom long after Lincoln was laid to rest that today we have the chance to face the challenges of this millennium together as one people  as Americans All of us know what those challenges are today  a war with no end a dependence on oil that threatens our future schools where too many children arent learning and families struggling paycheck to paycheck despite working as hard as they can We know the challenges Weve heard them Weve talked about them for years Whats stopped us from meeting these challenges is not the absence of sound policies and sensible plans Whats stopped us is the failure of leadership the smallness of our politics  the ease with which were distracted by the petty and trivial our chronic avoidance of tough decisions our preference for scoring cheap political points instead of rolling up our sleeves and building a working consensus to tackle big problems For the last six years weve been told that our mounting debts dont matter weve been told that the anxiety Americans feel about rising health care costs and stagnant wages are an illusion weve been told that climate change is a hoax and that tough talk and an illconceived war can replace diplomacy and strategy and foresight And when all else fails when Katrina happens or the death toll in Iraq mounts weve been told that our crises are somebody elses fault Were distracted from our real failures and told to blame the other party or gay people or immigrants And as people have looked away in disillusionment and frustration we know whats filled the void The cynics and the lobbyists and the special interests whove turned our government into a game only they can afford to play They write the checks and you get stuck with the bills they get the access while you get to write a letter they think they own this government but were here today to take it back The time for that politics is over Its time to turn the page Weve made some progress already I was proud to help lead the fight in Congress that led to the most sweeping ethics reform since Watergate But Washington has a long way to go And it wont be easy Thats why well have to set priorities Well have to make hard choices And although government will play a crucial role in bringing about the changes we need more money and programs alone will not get us where we need to go Each of us in our own lives will have to accept responsibility  for instilling an ethic of achievement in our children for adapting to a more competitive economy for strengthening our communities and sharing some measure of sacrifice So let us begin Let us begin this hard work together Let us transform this nation Let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age Lets set high standards for our schools and give them the resources they need to succeed Lets recruit a new army of teachers and give them better pay and more support in exchange for more accountability Lets make college more affordable and lets invest in scientific research and lets lay down broadband lines through the heart of inner cities and rural towns all across America And as our economy changes lets be the generation that ensures our nations workers are sharing in our prosperity Lets protect the hardearned benefits their companies have promised Lets make it possible for hardworking Americans to save for retirement And lets allow our unions and their organizers to lift up this countrys middleclass again Lets be the generation that ends poverty in America Every single person willing to work should be able to get job training that leads to a job and earn a living wage that can pay the bills and afford child care so their kids have a safe place to go when they work Lets do this Lets be the generation that finally tackles our health care crisis We can control costs by focusing on prevention by providing better treatment to the chronically ill and using technology to cut the bureaucracy Lets be the generation that says right here right now that we will have universal health care in America by the end of the next presidents first term Lets be the generation that finally frees America from the tyranny of oil We can harness homegrown alternative fuels like ethanol and spur the production of more fuelefficient cars We can set up a system for capping greenhouse gases We can turn this crisis of global warming into a moment of opportunity for innovation and job creation and an incentive for businesses that will serve as a model for the world Lets be the generation that makes future generations proud of what we did here Most of all lets be the generation that never forgets what happened on that September day and confront the terrorists with everything weve got Politics doesnt have to divide us on this anymore  we can work together to keep our country safe Ive worked with Republican Senator Dick Lugar to pass a law that will secure and destroy some of the worlds deadliest unguarded weapons We can work together to track terrorists down with a stronger military we can tighten the net around their finances and we can improve our intelligence capabilities But let us also understand that ultimate victory against our enemies will come only by rebuilding our alliances and exporting those ideals that bring hope and opportunity to millions around the globe But all of this cannot come to pass until we bring an end to this war in Iraq Most of you know I opposed this war from the start I thought it was a tragic mistake Today we grieve for the families who have lost loved ones the hearts that have been broken and the young lives that could have been America its time to start bringing our troops home Its time to admit that no amount of American lives can resolve the political disagreement that lies at the heart of someone elses civil war Thats why I have a plan that will bring our combat troops home by March of  Letting the Iraqis know that we will not be there forever is our last best hope to pressure the Sunni and Shia to come to the table and find peace Finally there is one other thing that is not too late to get right about this war  and that is the homecoming of the men and women  our veterans  who have sacrificed the most Let us honor their valor by providing the care they need and rebuilding the military they love Let us be the generation that begins this work I know there are those who dont believe we can do all these things I understand the skepticism After all every four years candidates from both parties make similar promises and I expect this year will be no different All of us running for president will travel around the country offering tenpoint plans and making grand speeches all of us will trumpet those qualities we believe make us uniquely qualified to lead the country But too many times after the election is over and the confetti is swept away all those promises fade from memory and the lobbyists and the special interests move in and people turn away disappointed as before left to struggle on their own That is why this campaign cant only be about me It must be about us  it must be about what we can do together This campaign must be the occasion the vehicle of your hopes and your dreams It will take your time your energy and your advice  to push us forward when were doing right and to let us know when were not This campaign has to be about reclaiming the meaning of citizenship restoring our sense of common purpose and realizing that few obstacles can withstand the power of millions of voices calling for change By ourselves this change will not happen Divided we are bound to fail But the life of a tall gangly selfmade Springfield lawyer tells us that a different future is possible He tells us that there is power in words He tells us that there is power in conviction That beneath all the differences of race and region faith and station we are one people He tells us that there is power in hope As Lincoln organized the forces arrayed against slavery he was heard to say Of strange discordant and even hostile elements we gathered from the four winds and formed and fought to battle through That is our purpose here today Thats why Im in this race Not just to hold an office but to gather with you to transform a nation I want to win that next battle  for justice and opportunity I want to win that next battle  for better schools and better jobs and health care for all I want us to take up the unfinished business of perfecting our union and building a better America And if you will join me in this improbable quest if you feel destiny calling and see as I see a future of endless possibility stretching before us if you sense as I sense that the time is now to shake off our slumber and slough off our fear and make good on the debt we owe past and future generations then Im ready to take up the cause and march with you and work with you Together starting today let us finish the work that needs to be done and usher in a new birth of freedom on this Earth Mr President I rise today both humbled and honored by the opportunity to express my support for renewal of the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act of  I want to thank the many people inside and outside of Congress who worked so hard over the past year to get us here We owe a debt of gratitude to the leadership on both sides of the aisle and we owe special thanks to Chairmen Sensenbrenner and Specter Ranking Members Conyers and Leahy and Rep Mel Watt Without their work and dedication  and the support of voting rights advocates around the country  I doubt this bill would have come before us so soon And I want to thank both chambers and both sides of the aisle for getting this done with the same broad support that drove the original Act  years ago At a time when Americans are frustrated with the partisan bickering that too often stalls our work the refreshing display of bipartisanship we are seeing today reflects our collective belief in the success of the Act and reminds us of how effective we can be when we work together Nobody can deny that weve come a long way since  Look at registration numbers Only two years after passage of the original Act registration numbers for minority voters in some states doubled Soon after not a single state covered by the Voting Rights Act had registered less than half of its minority votingage population Look at the influence of AfricanAmerican elected officials at all levels of government There are AfricanAmerican members of Congress Since  our nations top diplomat has been an AfricanAmerican In fact most of Americas elected AfricanAmerican officials come from the states covered by Section  of the Voting Rights Act  states like Mississippi and Alabama and Louisiana and Georgia But to me the most striking evidence of our progress can be found right across this building in my dear friend Congressman John Lewis who was on the front lines of the civil rights movement risking life and limb for freedom And on March   he led  peaceful protestors demanding the right to vote across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma Alabama Ive often thought about the people on the Edmund Pettus Bridge that day Not only John Lewis and Hosea Williams leading the march but the hundreds of everyday Americans who left their homes and their churches to join it Blacks and whites teenagers and children teachers and bankers and shopkeepers  a beloved community of Gods children ready to stand for freedom And I wonder where did they find that kind of courage When youre facing row after row of state troopers on horseback armed with billy clubs and tear gaswhen theyre coming toward you spewing hatred and violence how do you simply stop kneel down and pray to the Lord for salvation But the most amazing thing of all is that after that day  after John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life after peoples heads were gashed open and their eyes were burned and they watched their childrens innocence literally beaten out of themafter all that they went back to march again They marched again They crossed the bridge They awakened a nations conscience and not five months later the Voting Rights Act of  was signed into law And it was reauthorized in   and  Now in  John Lewis the physical scars from those marches still visible is an original cosponsor of the fourth reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act and he was joined last week by  of his House colleagues in voting for its passage There are some who argue the Act is no longer needed that the protections of Section s preclearance requirement  a requirement that ensures certain states are upholding the right to vote  are targeting the wrong states But the evidence refutes that notion Of the  objections issued by the Department of Justice since   occurred since the last reauthorization in  So despite the progress these states have made in upholding the right to vote its clear that problems still exist Others have argued against renewing Section s protection of language minorities Unfortunately these arguments have been tied to the debate over immigration and muddle a noncontroversial issue  protecting the right to vote  with one of todays most contentious debates But lets remember you cant request language assistance if youre not a voter and you cant be a voter if youre not a citizen And while voters as citizens must be proficient in English many are simply more confident that they can cast ballots printed in their native languages without making errors A representative of the Southwestern Voter Registration Project is quoted as saying Citizens who prefer Spanish registration cards do so because they feel more connected to the process they also feel they trust the process more when they understand it These sentiments  connection to and trust in our democratic process  are exactly what we want from our voting rights legislation Our challenges dont end at reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act either We have to prevent the problems weve seen in recent elections from happening again Weve seen political operatives purge voters from registration rolls for no legitimate reason prevent eligible exfelons from casting ballots distribute polling equipment unevenly and deceive voters about the time location and rules of elections Unfortunately these efforts have been directed primarily at minorities the disabled lowincome individuals and other historically disenfranchised groups The Help America Vote Act was a big step in the right direction but we need to do more We need to fully fund HAVA We need to enforce critical requirements like statewide registration databases We need to make sure polling equipment is distributed equitably and that the equipment works And we need to work on getting more people to the polls on election day We need to make sure that minority voters are not the subject of deplorable intimidation tactics when they do get to the polls In  Native American voters in South Dakota were confronted by men posing as law enforcement These hired intimidators joked about jail time for ballot missteps and followed voters to their cars to record their license plate numbers In Lake County Ohio some voters received a memo on bogus Board of Elections letterhead informing voters who registered through Democratic and NAACP drives that they could not vote In Wisconsin a flier purporting to be from the Milwaukee Black Voters League was circulated in predominantly AfricanAmerican neighborhoods with the following message If youve already voted in any election this year you cant vote in the presidential election If you violate any of these laws you can get ten years in prison and your children will get taken away from you So we have much more work to do This occasion is cause for celebration but its also an opportunity to renew our commitment to voting rights As Congressman Lewis said last week Its clear that we have come a great distance but we still have a great distance to go The memory of Selma still lives on in the spirit of the Voting Rights Act Since that day the Voting Rights Act has been a critical tool in ensuring that all Americans not only have the right to vote but the right to have their vote counted Those of us concerned about protecting those rights cant afford to sit on our laurels upon reauthorization of this bill We must take advantage of this rare united front and continue the fight to ensure unimpeded access to the polls for all Americans In other words we need to take the spirit that existed on that bridge and we have to spread it across this country Two weeks after the first march was turned back Dr King told a gathering of organizers and activists and community members that they should not despair because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice Thats because of the work that each of us do to bend it towards justice Its because of people like John Lewis and Fannie Lou Hamer and Coretta Scott King and Rosa Parks all the giants upon whose shoulders we stand that we are the beneficiaries of that arc bending towards justice Thats why I stand here today I would not be in the United States Senate had it not been for the efforts and courage of so many parents and grandparents and ordinary people who were willing to reach up and bend that arc in the direction of justice I hope we continue to see that spirit live on not just during this debate but throughout all our work here in the Senate Thank you Good morning President Bienen the Board of Trustees faculty parents family friends and the Class of  Congratulations on your graduation and thank you for allowing me the honor to be a part of it A few months ago I came across an article in your student newspaper by Elaine Meyer Elaine give me a little wave if youre out there There she is Glad to see you made it to graduation So Elaine wrote this article entitled Challenge us Senator Obama I thought this seemed like a fair request so I kept reading And I noticed that Elaine set out a few expectations for this speech According to the article Im supposed to be inspirational but not contrived Im supposed to be hopeful but not cheesy I should be political but not too political I should be better than John McCain but not so good that I have to spend the day with Jerry Falwell To further illustrate what she was looking for Elaine then very kindly quoted at length from the commencement address I gave at Knox College in Galesburg last year  which then completely ruined my plan to recycle that speech for this year Left with no speech and a lot of pressure I turned to who else but Elaine for help And what she wrote next is precisely what Id like to talk you about today She said When people say they dont want to hear about politics in a commencement address they are in part speaking of not wanting to hear about the outside world and its problems We students have been insulated enough for the past four years that it shouldnt hurt us to be challenged for thirty minutes especially on a day that marks our commencement into the real world That struck me as an important statement And it called to mind a passage from scriptures that some of you may know Corinthians  When I was a child I spoke as a child I felt as a child I thought as a child Now that I have become a man I have put away childish things I bring this up because theres an assumption in rites of passage like this that growing up is just a function of age that becoming an adult is an inevitable and natural progression But in fact I know a whole lot of thirty year olds and forty year olds and fifty year olds who are not yet fullgrown And if you talk to my wife shell tell you that there are times when I do not put aside childish things when I continually struggle to rise above the selfish or the petty or the small So even today as a US Senator I have to remind myself of certain lessons from my own youth  lessons about growing up and being true to my values and ideals The first lesson came during my first year in college Back then I had a tendency in my mothers words to act a bit casual about my future I rebelled angry in the way that many young men in general and young black man in particular are angry thinking that responsibility and hard work were oldfashioned conventions that didnt apply to me I partied a little too much and studied just enough to get by And once after a particularly long night of partying we had spilled a little too much beer broke a few too many bottles and trashed a little too much of the dorm And the next day the mess was so bad that when one of the cleaning ladies saw it she began to tear up And when a girlfriend of mine heard about this she said to me That woman couldve been my grandmother Barack She spent her days cleaning up after somebody elses mess Which drove home for me the first lesson of growing up The world doesnt just revolve around you Theres a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit But I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit  the ability to put ourselves in someone elses shoes to see the world through those who are different from us  the child whos hungry the laidoff steelworker the immigrant woman cleaning your dorm room As you go on in life cultivating this quality of empathy will become harder not easier Theres no community service requirement in the real world no one forcing you to care Youll be free to live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself and send your kids to the same schools and narrow your concerns to whats going in your own little circle Not only that  we live in a culture that discourages empathy A culture that too often tells us our principle goal in life is to be rich thin young famous safe and entertained A culture where those in power too often encourage these selfish impulses They will tell you that the Americans who sleep in the streets and beg for food got there because theyre all lazy or weak of spirit That the innercity children who are trapped in dilapidated schools cant learn and wont learn and so we should just give up on them entirely That the innocent people being slaughtered and expelled from their homes half a world away are somebody elses problem to take care of I hope you dont listen to this I hope you choose to broaden and not contract your ambit of concern Not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate although you do have that obligation Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are although you do have that debt Its because you have an obligation to yourself Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation And because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential  and become fullgrown The second lesson I learned after college when I had this crazy idea that I wanted to be a community organizer and work in lowincome neighborhoods My mother and grandparents thought I should go to law school My friends had applied for jobs on Wall Street But I went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that I could think of And finally this small group of churches on the south side of Chicago wrote back and gave me a job organizing neighborhoods devastated by steelplant closings in the early s The churches didnt have much money  so they offered me a grand sum of  a year plus  to buy a car And I got ready to move to Chicago  a place I had never been and where I didnt know a living soul Even people who didnt know me were skeptical of my decision I remember having a conversation with an older man I had met before I arrived in Chicago I told him about my plans and he looked at me and said Let me tell something You look like a nice cleancut young man and youve got a nice voice So let me give you a piece of advice  forget this community organizing business You cant change the world and people wont appreciate you trying What you should do is go into television broadcasting Im telling you youve got a future I couldve taken my mothers advice and I couldve taken my grandparents advice I couldve taken the path my friends traveled And objectively speaking that TV thing might have made some sense But I knew there was something in me that wanted to try for something bigger So the second lesson is this Challenge yourself Take some risks in your life This may be difficult for all of you because one of the great things about graduating from Northwestern is that you can now punch your own ticket You can take your diploma walk off this stage and go chasing after the big house and the large salary and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should buy But I hope you dont Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition It asks too little of yourself And it will leave you unfulfilled I often think about the young Americans  teenagers and college kids not much older than you  from all over the country watching the Civil Rights Movement unfold before them on their television sets I imagine that they wouldve seen the marchers and heard the speeches but they also probably saw the dogs and the fire hoses or the footage of innocent people being beaten within an inch of their lives or heard the news the day those four little girls died when someone threw a bomb into their church Instinctively they knew that it was safer and smarter to stay at home to watch the movement from afar But they also understood that these people in Georgia and Alabama and Mississippi were their brothers and sisters that what was happening was wrong and that they had an obligation to make it right When the buses pulled up for a Freedom Ride down South they got on They took a risk And they changed the world So dont let people talk you into doing the safe thing Listen to whats inside of you and decide what it is that you care about so much that youre willing to risk it all The third lesson is one that I learned once I got to Chicago I had spent weeks organizing our very first community meeting around the issue of gang violence We invited the police we made phone calls went to churches and passed out flyers I had been warned of the turf battles and bad politics between certain community leaders but I ignored them confident that I knew what I was doing The night of the meeting we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of the crowd And we waited And we waited And finally a group of older people walk in to the hall And they sit down And this little old lady raises her hand and asks Is this where the bingo game is Thirteen people showed up that night The police never came And the meeting was a complete disaster Later the volunteers I worked with told me they were quitting  that they had been doing this for two years and had nothing to show for it I was tired too But at that point I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street tossing stones at boardedup apartment building And I turned to the volunteers and I asked them Before you quit I want you to answer one question Whats gonna happen to those boys Who will fight for them if not us Who will give them a fair shot if we leave And at that moment we were all reminded of a third lesson in growing up Persevere Making your mark on the world is hard If it were easy everybody would do it But its not It takes patience it takes commitment and it comes with plenty of failure along the way The real test is not whether you avoid this failure because you wont its whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction or whether you learn from it whether you choose to persevere After my little speech that day one by one the volunteers decided not to quit We went back to those neighborhoods and we kept at it sustaining ourselves with the small victories And over time a community changed And so had we Cultivating empathy challenging yourself persevering in the face of adversity  these are the qualities that Ive found to be important in my own life But whats true for individuals can also be true for nations For what America needs right now more than ever is a sense of purpose to guide us through the challenges that lie ahead a maturity that we seem to have lost somewhere along the way a willingness to engage in a sober adult conversation about our future When we measure our greatness as a nation by how far the stock market rises or falls instead of how many opportunities weve opened up for Americas children were displaying a preference for the childish When we believe that force is the only way to accomplish our ends in the world when our leaders exaggerate or fudge the truth we havent set aside childish things When we run our budget into red ink for things that we want instead of things that we need were indicating that were not yet fullgrown For a brief moment there was the hope that this kind of politics wouldve ended after  There was a sense of unity born from the rubble of those buildings  young people signing up to serve political leaders of both parties working together people asking new questions about our world hungry for the answers But at some point we began to drift Republican and Democrat alike went back to procrastinating about problems that we now have to face We sent young Americans to fight a war without asking anyone back home to sacrifice their time or their tax cut We argue about the inconsequential and caricature our opponents to score cheap political points Our media returned to covering the sensational and feeding our evershortening attention span And in the meantime our problems are left to fester We have a global economy thats forcing us to compete like never before In todays world a job can now travel anywhere theres an internet connection and a worker whos smart and skilled And if China and India keep educating their kids better and longer than we are thats where the jobs will go We can meet this challenge if we fix our schools if we make college affordable if we train our workers if we invest more in research and technology We know what needs to be done Whats lacking is the political will We have a health care crisis in this country thats left  million Americans uninsured thats left millions unable to deal with rising copayments thats left businesses near bankruptcy We can meet this challenge if we modernize our health care system if we improve quality if we pool our resources to bargain for affordable insurance Whats been lacking is the political will We have an energy crisis thats keeping gas prices high destroying our climate and forcing us to send billions of dollars to the very countries who want to cause us harm We can meet this challenge if we harness alternative fuels and build cars that go further on a tank of gas But we need to find the will to make it happen We need new strategies to fight the war on terror In a world where terrorists can hide and blend into any city on the planet we cant just believe  as Bill Clinton says  that we can kill or jail every single one of our enemies We can meet this challenge if we realize this isnt just battle of armies but also of ideas if we rebuild our institutions and strengthen our alliances as Truman and Acheson and Keenan and Marshall did after World War II if we bring hope to those pockets of desperation where a jihad is a better bet than a job But whats lacking is that political will Each and every one of these challenges call for an America that is more purposeful more grownup than the America that we have today An America that reflects the lessons that have helped so many of its people mature in their own lives An America thats about not just each of us but all of us An America that takes great risks in the face of greater odds An America that above all perseveres Over one hundred and fifty classes have sat where you sit today some in good times others in bad Some were years that just rolled into the next and others would mark a turning point in our nation The class of  would find their country torn apart by civil war in less than a year Many of them would listen to their President tell them that a house divided cannot stand and they would answer the call to save a union and free a people The class of  would look out a nation in mired in depression a nation illfed illclothed and illhoused They would hear a man who could not lift himself from his wheelchair lift a nation by telling us that it was only fear itself standing in our way And they would answer the call to conquer that fear The class of  would find themselves at the beginning of a decade where social and racial strife threatened to tear apart the very fabric of the nation They would hear a young President urge them to ask what they could do for their country And they would answer the call to sit at lunch counters and take those Freedom Rides they would march for justice and live for equality And now it is  And here you sit facing challenges as great as any in the past And the choice is yours Will the years pass with barely a whisper from your generation Or will we look back on this time as the moment where you took a stand and changed the world Time will tell You will be tested by the challenges of this new century and at times you will fail But know that you have it within your power to try That generations who have come before you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time And that if were willing to shoulder each others burdens to take great risks and to persevere through trial America will continue on its magnificent journey towards that distant horizon and a better day Thank you so much to the class of  congratulations on your graduation and Elaine  I hope I did okay Mr President I come to the floor today to discuss the bipartisan employment verification system amendment that Senators Grassley Kennedy Kyl and I have introduced One of the central components of immigration reform is enforcement and this bill contains a number of important provisions to beef up border security But thats not enough Real enforcement also means drying up the pool of jobs that encourages illegal immigration And that can only happen if employers dont hire illegal workers Unfortunately our current employer enforcement system does little to nothing to deter illegal immigrants from finding work Overall the number of workplace arrests of illegal immigrants fell from  in  to  in  even as illegal immigration grew during that time Moreover between  to  of all undocumented immigrants are people who have overstayed their visas And the only way to effectively deter overstays is to reduce access to employment When Congress last passed an immigration bill in  we didnt provide a meaningful way for employers to check legal eligibility to work Currently employees can prove their legal status by showing a variety of documents and employers are supposed to record their inspection of such documents by filling out an I form for each employee As a result the market for fraudulent documents  fake Social Security cards drivers licenses birth certificates  has exploded But with more than  million employees in more than  million workplaces and only about  Wage and Hour investigators employer sanctions have become merely a nuisance requirement to maintain records not a serious risk of penalties As a result the number of intent to fine notices issued to employers for hiring undocumented workers dropped from  in  to just three in  Understandably employers cannot always detect forged documents And employers who reject workers with questionable documents risk an employment discrimination suit Thats why we need a better alternative We need an electronic verification system that can effectively detect the use of fraudulent documents significantly reduce the employment of illegal workers and give employers the confidence that their workforce is legal When Congress first considered comprehensive immigration reform in April the legislation on the floor addressed this problem by creating a national employment eligibility verification system Senators Grassley Kyl and I all thought that was a good idea in theory but we had concerns with the design of the system Senators Grassley and Kyl proposed that the verification system be implemented nationally within  months Senators Kennedy and I proposed that the system be phased in over five years but that it also include additional accuracy and privacy standards as well as strict prohibitions on use of the system to discriminate against workers For the past few weeks our staffs have worked together in a bipartisan effort to negotiate a substitute that took the concerns of both proposals into consideration Im pleased that weve reached an agreement Under our compromise amendment all employers would have to participate  months after the Department of Homeland Security receives the appropriations needed to fund the system All new employees hired would have to be run through the system and a series of privacy and accuracy standards would protect citizens and legal immigrants from errors in the system and breaches of private information And to make sure that employers take the system seriously we strengthen civil penalties for employers who hire unauthorized workers and we establish criminal penalties for repeat violators Weve worked in a constructive bipartisan manner to design an employment verification system that is fair to legal workers and tough on illegal workers This is a good amendment and I urge my colleagues to support it Thank you Mr President I am proud to be sponsoring this amendment with the senior senator from West Virginia Hes absolutely right that Congress has abrogated its oversight responsibilities and one way to reverse that troubling trend is to adopt a sunset provision in this bill We did that in the Patriot Act and that allowed us to make important revisions to the bill that reflected our experience about what worked and didnt work during the previous  years We should do that again with this important piece of legislation But I want to take a few minutes to speak more broadly about the bill before us I may have only been in this body for a short while but I am not naive to the political considerations that go along with many of the decisions we make here I realize that soon we will adjourn for the fall and the campaigning will begin in earnest And there will be second attack ads and negative mail pieces and we will be criticized as caring more about the rights of terrorists than the protection of Americans And I know that the vote before us was specifically designed and timed to add more fuel to that fire And yet while I know all of this Im still disappointed Because what were doing here today  a debate over the fundamental human rights of the accused  should be bigger than politics This is serious If this was a debate with obvious ideological differences  heartfelt convictions that couldnt be settled by compromise  I would understand But its not All of us  Democrats and Republicans  want to do whatever it takes to track down terrorists and bring them to justice as swiftly as possible All of us want to give our President every tool necessary to do this And all of us were willing to do that in this bill Anyone who says otherwise is lying to the American people In the five years that the Presidents system of military tribunals has existed not one terrorist has been tried Not one has been convicted And in the end the Supreme Court of the United found the whole thing unconstitutional which is why were here today We could have fixed all of this in a way that allows us to detain and interrogate and try suspected terrorists while still protecting the accidentally accused from spending their lives locked away in Guantanamo Bay Easily This was not an eitheror question Instead of allowing this President  or any President  to decide what does and does not constitute torture we could have left the definition up to our own laws and to the Geneva Conventions as we would have if we passed the bill that the Armed Services committee originally offered Instead of detainees arriving at Guantanamo and facing a Combatant Status Review Tribunal that allows them no real chance to prove their innocence with evidence or a lawyer we could have developed a real military system of justice that would sort out the suspected terrorists from the accidentally accused And instead of not just suspending but eliminating the right of habeas corpus  the seven centuryold right of individuals to challenge the terms of their own detention we could have given the accused one chance  one single chance  to ask the government why they are being held and what they are being charged with But politics won today Politics won The Administration got its vote and now it will have its victory lap and now they will be able to go out on the campaign trail and tell the American people that they were the ones who were tough on the terrorists And yet we have a bill that gives the terrorist mastermind of  his day in court but not the innocent people we may have accidentally rounded up and mistaken for terrorists  people who may stay in prison for the rest of their lives And yet we have a report authored by sixteen of our own governments intelligence agencies a previous draft of which described and I quote actions by the United States government that were determined to have stoked the jihad movement like the indefinite detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay And yet we have Al Qaeda and the Taliban regrouping in Afghanistan while we look the other way We have a war in Iraq that our own governments intelligence says is serving as Al Qaedas best recruitment tool And we have recommendations from the bipartisan  commission that we still refuse to implement five years after the fact The problem with this bill is not that its too tough on terrorists The problem with this bill is that its sloppy And the reason its sloppy is because we rushed it to serve political purposes instead of taking the time to do the job right Ive heard for example the argument that it should be military courts and not federal judges who should make decisions on these detainees I actually agree with that The problem is that the structure of the military proceedings has been poorly thought through Indeed the regulations that are supposed to be governing administrative hearings for these detainees which should have been issued months ago still havent been issued Instead we have rushed through a bill that stands a good chance of being challenged once again in the Supreme Court This is not how a serious Administration would approach the problem of terrorism I know the President came here today and was insisting that this is supposed to be our primary concern Hes absolutely right it should be our primary concern  which is why we should be approaching this with a somberness and seriousness that this Administration has not displayed with this legislation Now let me be clear  for those who plot terror against the United States I hope God has mercy on their soul because I certainly do not And for those who our government suspects of terror I support whatever tools are necessary to try them and uncover their plot But we also know that some have been detained who have no connection to terror whatsoever Weve already had reports from the CIA and various generals over the last few years saying that many of the detainees at Guantanamo shouldnt have been there  as one US commander of Guantanamo told the Wall Street Journal Sometimes we just didnt get the right folks And we all know about the recent case of the Canadian man who was suspected of terrorist connections detained in New York sent to Syria and tortured only to find out later that it was all a case of mistaken identity and poor information In the future people like this may never have a chance to prove their innocence They may remain locked away forever And the sad part about all of this is that this betrayal of American values is unnecessary We couldve drafted a bipartisan wellstructured bill that provided adequate due process through the military courts had an effective review process that wouldve prevented frivolous lawsuits being filed and kept lawyers from clogging our courts but upheld the basic ideals that have made this country great Instead what we have is a flawed document that in fact betrays the best instincts of some of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  those who worked in a bipartisan fashion in the Armed Services Committee to craft a bill that we could have been proud of And they essentially got steamrolled by this Administration and by the imperatives of November th That is not how we should be doing business in the US Senate and thats not how we should be prosecuting this war on terrorism When were sloppy and cut corners we are undermining those very virtues of America that will lead us to success in winning this war At bare minimum I hope we can at least pass this provision so that cooler heads can prevail after the silly season of politics is over Thank you
